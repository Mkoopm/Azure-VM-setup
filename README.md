# Azure-VM-setup
It can be challenging to properly setup a VM in Azure to run LLM's.
Not only is a relatively expensive VM needed, but also Cuda install should be taken care of amongst other things.
The aim of this repository is to simplify that process. 
It contains deployement and setup scripts for an Azure VM to run models on a GPU.
In the future it might come to include a clientless remote desktop as well.
